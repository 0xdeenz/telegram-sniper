# Telegram sniper
DeFi sniper for Telegram messages, with a built-in Telegram bot and easy to use user interface

CurrySniper was the official name under which it was marketed. In the BSC space, the PnD scams unfortunately earned a reputation between users for being "Indian scams". 
The product name and messages the bot sends were a simple marketing move and humorous take to attract users that had been previously scammed.

## How to use it 
First, you should set up a Telegram bot which will be use to interact with the program -- a sort of interface.
Under __main.py__ you should provide your Telegram user ID, and then the API values for this bot you set up. After which, you are ready to run your Telegram sniper, and start scamming scammers!
